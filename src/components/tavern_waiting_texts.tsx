        <p>A man and a woman enter the tavern, dressed in extravagant clothing.</p>
        <p>The bartender immediately pulls a case of wine out and hands it to them, making light conversation.</p>
        <p>It sounds as though they are getting married soon.</p>
        <p>You are about to stand up and congratulate them, but the bartender sends you a quick glance, indicating that you should stay put.</p>

        <p>A bird lands in your hair... A bird lands in your hair!</p>
        <p>You try to knock it off of you, but it proves much more difficult than you thought it would.</p>
        <p>After several minutes a woman walks over and puts the bird in a cage.</p>
        <p>"You should learn to mind your own business!", she says scornfully as something whiteish and liquidyish runs down your face.</p>
